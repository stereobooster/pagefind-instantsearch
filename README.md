# Facets monorepo

It is the monorepo repository:

- [InstantSearch adapter for pagefind](/packages/pagefind-instantsearch/) ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40stereobooster/pagefind-instantsearch)
- and [demo site](/packages/demo/README.md)

> [!WARNING]  
> Appearantly pagefind also supports [faceted search](https://pagefind.app/docs/js-api-filtering/) and [loading data from json](https://pagefind.app/docs/node-api/). I found out it only after implemented this library. I want to try it out
